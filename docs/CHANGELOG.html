			</ul>
			<p><strong>Game Installation System </strong></p>
			<p>I have implemented a new system that allows new games to be installed with no hassle on the user end. The downloads page at http://www.phpraider.com/ will now have a subfolder with game types. In order to install your server must have ZIP support enabled (enabled by default on most systems) and you must have access to the configuration page. By the game type you will see an &quot;Install New&quot; link. Click the link, select the zip file, and hit submit. All images will be copied to the correct location and the database file will be executed which includes the game definitions, roles, attributes, and genders. Afterwards, you <strong>must </strong>select the game in the game dropdown box and save the configuration changes.</p>
			<p>Adding a new game is simple. Extract the WoW_Alliance or WoW_Horde files to see the directory structure as well as the install.sql file. Create a local directory structure with the new game that matches the structure of the WoW files. Extract the database information (phpMyAdmin works great) and ZIP the file. You can either post the game file on the forums or email it to me and once it's verified I will add it to the official game list.</p>
			<p><strong>New Role System</strong></p>
			<p>Due to the changes to signups and roles all previous raid signups will not function with RC8. If you use RC7 in a raid enviornment I suggest waiting until ALL current raids have passed until upgrading to RC8. </p>
